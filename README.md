# Sentiment_Classification_BiLSTM_CNN
Using emotional analysis to study the impact factors of customer product satisfaction can provide timely suggestions for product managers and improve the efficiency of product management. In this paper, we implement Bi-LSTM-CNN neural network models for text sentiment classification using GloVe and aim to investigate positive and negative attitudes towards Amazon product review datasets extracted from different domains. Then we analyse the performance of the proposed models with precision, recall, f-measure, and accuracy as compared to the baseline model. Experimental results indicate that multilayer of convolution extracts features are more efficient and prove that narrowing the category of data can increase correctness in terms of sentiment classification.
